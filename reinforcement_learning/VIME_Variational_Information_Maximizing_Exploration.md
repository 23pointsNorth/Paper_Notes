# VIME: Variational Information Maximizing Exploration

I'm reading this paper as I want to know more about how information theory gets
applied to reinforcement learning.

**TL;DR: VIME provides a better exploration strategy than the heuristics such as
epsilon-greedy methods by ensuring that the agent selects actions that maximize
information gain about the environment.**
