# Human-Level Control Through Deep Reinforcement Learning

I think I know this paper sufficiently well that I don't need a summary for it. (For both the Nature and NIPS papers ... but the latter is subsumed by the former anyway.) I may look at the Nature paper now and then if I'm implementing DQN. Anyway, that's all for here, please check other paper summaries which are much longer.
