# Large-Scale Distributed Bayesian Matrix Factorization using Stochastic Gradient MCMC

I would like to understand this paper with respect to the matrix factorization
case. I do the same with BIDMach and its SMF.scala code, though I don't really
use "anything Bayesian," i.e. I tend to set the priors to be uniform and ignore
them. I also use John Canny's specialized algorithm (which is not quite the same
as the textbook description of Alternating Least Squares).

TODO these notes are in progress ...
